# Overview
This framework facilitates the development of iOS apps that utilize Wearable or Nearable Devices. It helps developing those apps in just a fraction of the time and requiring only minimal knowledge of the Wearable/Nearable domain.

It handles these key aspects of utilizing these devices:
- Connecting to the Wearable/Nearable Devices.
- Retrieving data from a specific sensor.
- Making the data available in a standard way regardless of the sensor's make.
- Interpreting raw data and identifying meaningful situations that can be acted upon.
- Identifying Gestures (coming soon)
