# Overview
This framework facilitates the development of iOS apps that utilize Wearable or Nearable Devices. It facilitates the development in just a fraction of the time and requires only minimal knowledge of the Wearable/Nearable domain.

It is especially helpful for building solutions that use the computing power of the smartphone to interpret raw data from Wearables into meaningful situations that can be acted upon.

It handles some of the key aspects of building Wearable solutions:
- Connecting to the Wearable/Nearable Devices
- Retrieving data from sensors
- Making the data available in a standard way regardless of the sensor's make
- Interpreting raw data and identifying meaningful situations that can be acted upon
- Identifying Gestures

It is accompanied by rich documentation and sample code.

This framework follows the paradigm illustrated in the diagram below: 
The mobile device is applied as a first-line computation resource for processing the huge amount of data collected from Wearable Devices and turning it into insights about the user's current context and situation. You may then trigger the necessary actions or send the insightful information to the cloud for further processing and interoperability with other applications.

# Documentation
Please visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/ibm-wearables-sdk-for-mobile/ios/wiki).

# Gesture Recognition
The client-side components of Gesture Recognition are open source and are available here. Learning a new gesture and generating a corresponding algorithm utilizes a cloud service that requires an activation code. The code can be freely obtained [here](http://wearables.mybluemix.net/).
