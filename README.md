# Overview
This framework facilitates the development of iOS apps that utilize Wearable or Nearable Devices. It helps developing those apps in just a fraction of the time and requiring only minimal knowledge of the Wearable/Nearable domain.

It is especially helpful for building solutions that use the compute power of the smartphone to interpret raw data from Wearables into meaningful situations that can be acted upon.

It handles these key aspects of utilizing these devices:
- Connecting to the Wearable/Nearable Devices.
- Retrieving data from a specific sensor.
- Making the data available in a standard way regardless of the sensor's make.
- Interpreting raw data and identifying meaningful situations that can be acted upon.
- Identifying Gestures (coming soon)

It is accompanied by documentation and sample code.

# Gesture Recognition
The client-side components of the Gesture Recognition are open source and are available here. Learning a new gesture and generating a corresponding algorithm necessiates utilization of a cloud service that requires an activation code. The code can be freely obtained [here](http://wearables.mybluemix.net/).
